## Dracula on Solus
I switched to Solus a while ago since I like independent distros, the Budgie DE and a 'just works' distro. Arch has been broken a lot and I don't want to deal with those hassle.

## Dude, stop...
Solus has some performance issues for me so I got back to Arch, firstly with KDE but it's too heavy on disk space so I switched to DWM for few days before discovering LXDE. This repo might stop being updated because there's nothing more to rice...

I've patched it a bit, including:
- [dwm fullgaps](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/fullgaps/)
- [dwm systray](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/systray/)
- [st alpha](https://st.suckless.org/patches/alpha/)
- [st scrollback](https://st.suckless.org/patches/scrollback/) the first one

I got fed up with patching manually, although dwm is great :)
