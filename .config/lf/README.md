# `lf` configuration
- Image preview: Make sure your terminal supports, then install [these dependencies](https://github.com/cirala/lfimg).
- I do use `vlc`, [wine](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/wine) and `nvim` in this configuration. Alter this to your needs.
- Archive: Install `unzip` and [7zz](https://www.7-zip.org/).
- Drag & drop: Install `dragon-drop` (AUR).
- **Movement section: EDIT THIS!**
